# refactor-challenge
This project was to teach students stuyding at the University of Birmingham front end developer bootcamp how to refactor an existing code. In this particular task the goal was to make the website more accessible and make sure all the links work accordingly. 

The 'Search Engine Optimization' link did not work as the div was missing the "id=" and "class=" - This was rectified and when clicking on the link it brings you to th ecorrect section of the page.
All the pictures were also misisng an alt attribute explaining what the pictures are.
